This tar file contains the compiler clang20 and the files necessary to compile binaries and libraries for Android on an arm64 CPU from the Android NDK r29-beta1 compiled for Android on arm64 CPUs.

The tar file is an add-on for the tar file with the clang19 toolchain for Android on arm64 CPUs, but can also be used without the files from the tar archive with clang19 if the other files from 
the toolchain for clang19 are either not required or are provided by other methods.


The tar file with the clang19 toolchaing is available here:

https://bnsmb.de/files/public/Android/clang19_toolchain-v1.2.0_release_23.03.2025_.tar.gz

(see https://xdaforums.com/t/guide-how-to-install-a-toolchain-for-clang-on-phones-without-root-access.4710235/ for infos about the tar file with clang19)


To use the clang20 in this tar archive, install and initialize the tar file with the clang19 and then copy this tar file to the phone and unpack it in the directory /data/local/tmp:

cd /data/local/tmp 
tar -xf /sdcard/Download/clang20_for_Android_22.04.2025_v1.0.0-2487801.tar.gz


The clang20 files are then in the directory 

/data/local/tmp/sysroot/usr/clang20


The binaries for clang20 are in the directory

/data/local/tmp/sysroot/usr/clang20/bin


The files from the Android NDK are in the directory

/data/local/tmp/sysroot/usr/ndk/r29-beta1

The sysroot from the Android NDK is in the directory

/data/local/tmp/sysroot/usr/ndk/r29-beta1/sysroot


Use the command 

source /data/local/tmp/sysroot/bin/init_clang20_env

to init the environment for the clang20. This script defines all necessary environment variables (including the PATH variable) to use the clang20.


The script init_clang20_env executes the script

/data/local/tmp/local_init_clang20_env

if it exists (use the parameter "no_user" to disable the execution of that script)


Use the command 

/data/local/tmp/sysroot/bin/init_clang20_env help

to print the usage help for the init script


The tar archive also contains the source code for two simple C/C++ programs to test the compiler; the commands to use them to create the test programs are:

cd /data/local/tmp/sysroot/usr/share/clang20/
clang ${CFLAGS} ${LDFLAGS} -o helloworld_in_c helloworld_in_c.c  && ./helloworld_in_c

cd /data/local/tmp/sysroot/usr/share/clang20/
clang++ ${CXXFLAGS} -lc++_shared ${LDFLAGS}  -o helloworld_in_c++ ./helloworld_in_c++.cpp && ./helloworld_in_c++



Source Code used to create the binaries
---------------------------------------

The repository with the source code for the clang is:

https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm-project

The source code was checked out in 04/2025


To get the source for clang20 use these commands: 

git clone https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm-project

cd llvm-project

git checkout llvm-r547379-release


See the file 

./sysroot/usr/share/clang20/source/myconfigure_for_clang20

in the tar archive for the cmake options used to prepare the build process for the clang20.
The clang20 binaries were compiled on a machine running the Linux OS with the Cross Compiler from the Android NDK r27b


The Android NDKs are available here:
